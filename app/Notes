1. Doesn't work well with versions
2. Good at troubleshooting - enter error and GPT will correct code
3. It got harder when asked to create @Preview and need in abstraction required
4. GPT suggests features to be implemented and guides throw implementation. It
makes decisions like how to implement navigation in the app.
5. OOP is human concept, machines can adopt it, but will be perfectly generate
code without such limitations.
6. At some point I stopped thinking and just copy/pasted code until it not working
7. Since it doesn't have memory, GPT may generate next snippet slightly different
from previously written - you either handle this yourself or ask for correction.

(I apologize for the oversight.)
